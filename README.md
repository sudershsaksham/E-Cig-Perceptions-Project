# The Effect of Locality on Student's Perceptions of E-Cigarette Use

## Introduction
This research tackles the question of how a school’s location in an urban or rural area affects its students’ perception of e-cigarette use in Canada. 
To answer this question, the Canadian Student Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey 2018/2019 is used, which can be found [here](https://abacus.library.ubc.ca/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=hdl:11272.1/AB2/WEFOHY). 

By taking into account the student’s current smoking status, their sex at birth, and their grade, we use a linear regression to explore this dataset.
